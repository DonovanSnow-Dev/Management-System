:book: Please Note:

This project was designed in visual studio 2019 and on multiple devices
over the months i lost track of it due to a string of events and so
The files and such will be added once i find them and sort out my Drive
my drive is in a state of utter chaos used the same Drive when i was in middle school.
at first i wanted to use the Template studio wizard , but i instead decided to use it as a sort
of base without the templates offerd
